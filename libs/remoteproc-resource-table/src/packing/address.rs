//! Types to represent device-side pointers (32-bit) in resource tables.
//!
//! This address type must store a pointer (not plain integer), because resource table entries are often initialized via
//! an an unresolved linker symbol. It has a 4-byte memory representation.
//!
//! To enable testing of resource table generation, we need to retain the 4-byte representation on 64-bit systems. We've
//! shimmed the type on 64-bit targets to store a 32-bit integer, which is sufficient for faithful representation tests.
